# `interface` ResolvedModule

[Documentation Index](../README.md)

Represents the result of module resolution.
Module resolution will pick up tsx/jsx/js files even if '--jsx' and '--allowJs' are turned off.
The Program will then filter results based on these flags.

Prefer to return a `ResolvedModuleFull` so that the file type does not have to be inferred.

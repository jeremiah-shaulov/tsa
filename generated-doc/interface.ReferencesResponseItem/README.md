#### ðŸ“„ lineText?: `string`

> Text of line containing the reference. Including this
> with the response avoids latency of editor loading files
> to show text of reference line (the server already has loaded the referencing files).
> 
> If [UserPreferences.disableLineTextInReferences](../interface.UserPreferences/README.md#-readonly-disablelinetextinreferences-boolean) is enabled, the property won't be filled



#### ðŸ“„ isWriteAccess: `boolean`

> True if reference is a write location, false otherwise.



#### ðŸ“„ isDefinition?: `boolean`

> Present only if the search was triggered from a declaration.
> True indicates that the references refers to the same symbol
> (i.e. has the same meaning) as the declaration that began the
> search.
